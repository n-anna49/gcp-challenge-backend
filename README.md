# GCP Challenge Backend
The following files consist of the backend portion of the GCP challenge. A Python Flask application was created (main.py) with a single endpoint, which increments a Firestore database field number by one. A requirements.txt file was also created to provide the necessary dependencies to run the app.

The application was containerized using Docker for portability. The Dockerfile sets up the instructions for building the image. The .dockerignore file prevents unnecessary files from being put in the image.
